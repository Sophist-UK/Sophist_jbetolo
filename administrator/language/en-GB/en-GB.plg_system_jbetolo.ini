If CDN is such that it only respects whatever we serve it with (which most of them are such as Amazons cloudfront) we will want to set this to No and jbetolo will serve compressed version to it with correct content-encoding header. In order to achieve the last part we would need to provide a .htacces or entry in nginx configuration file that sets the header for apache and nginx servers respectively.

By having jbetolo merge/minimize and deliver in the cache a batch of resource files which your CDN server pulls away you would be able to achieve the most optimal setup. You would not need to maintain your contents on the CDN server as they are fetched automatically by the CDN service provider as soon as they are requested by users. Most response headers set by your servers will be respected by the CDN servers. Additional advantages with CDN servers are ability to ease load on your own server and also tapping into a much wider dedicated single purpose servers optimized to serve your contents.<br />2. Own Pull CDN(local) - this is jbetolos own implementation immitating Pull CDN servers. Requires only that you setup a subdomain and that your server has URL rewrite capability through .htaccess and jbetolo deals with the rest and should function just as the remote Pull CDN. There are still some minor quirks we need to deal with such as correct header setting."
